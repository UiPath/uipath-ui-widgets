# @uipath/ui-widgets-multi-file-upload

A React widget for uploading multiple files simultaneously to an [Orchestrator Storage Bucket](https://uipath.github.io/uipath-typescript/api/interfaces/BucketServiceModel/).

## Features

- Upload multiple files simultaneously
- Drag and drop support
- File type validation via the `accept` attribute
- File size validation
- Error handling
- Built on the Apollo Wind `FileUpload` component

## Installation

```bash
npm install @uipath/ui-widgets-multi-file-upload
```

### Peer dependencies

```bash
npm install react@^19.2.0 react-dom@^19.2.0 @uipath/uipath-typescript@^1.4.1
```

> **Warning: The published 1.0.0 pins an older SDK**
> `@uipath/ui-widgets-multi-file-upload@1.0.0` — currently the only published version — declares an exact peer of `@uipath/uipath-typescript@1.1.1`, which the range above does not satisfy, so npm reports an unmet peer dependency. The `^1.4.1` above is what the widget is built against today and what the next release will carry.

## Usage

> **Note: Theming**
> Add either a `light` or `dark` class to your HTML `<body>` element to enable proper theming.

```tsx
import { MultiFileUpload } from "@uipath/ui-widgets-multi-file-upload";
import "@uipath/ui-widgets-multi-file-upload/MultiFileUpload.css";
import { UiPath } from "@uipath/uipath-typescript/core";
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

function App() {
  const [sdk, setSdk] = useState<UiPath | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const init = async () => {
      const uipath = new UiPath({
        baseUrl: "https://api.uipath.com",
        orgName: "your-org",
        tenantName: "your-tenant",
        clientId: "your-client-id",
        redirectUri: "http://localhost:3000/callback",
        // Uploading needs the full `OR.Buckets` scope
        scope: "OR.Buckets",
      });
      await uipath.initialize();
      setSdk(uipath);
    };
    init();
  }, []);

  const handleUploadError = (error: Error) => {
    console.error("Upload failed:", error);
  };

  const handleUploadSuccess = (uploadedFiles: File[]) => {
    console.log(
      "Successfully uploaded:",
      uploadedFiles.map((f) => f.name),
    );
  };

  if (!sdk) return <div>Loading...</div>;

  return (
    <MultiFileUpload
      sdk={sdk}
      bucketId={123}
      folderId={456}
      path="uploads/"
      onUploadError={handleUploadError}
      onUploadSuccess={handleUploadSuccess}
      maxFileSizeInMb={10}
      accept=".pdf,.jpg,.png"
    />
  );
}
```

> **Tip: Finding the bucket and folder IDs**
> List the buckets you can reach with the Buckets service — the cross-folder `getAll()` response carries the bucket `id` alongside its `folderId`. See the [Bucket service reference](https://uipath.github.io/uipath-typescript/api/interfaces/BucketServiceModel/):
>
> ```ts
> import { Buckets } from "@uipath/uipath-typescript/buckets";
>
> const buckets = await new Buckets(sdk).getAll();
> ```
